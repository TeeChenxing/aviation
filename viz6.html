                      This scatter plot visualizes total fatal aircraft injuries
                      over time, starting from 1980, with filtering options by
                      the severity of aircraft damage. The marks in this
                      visualization are scatter points, each representing a
                      single incident. The channels include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <b>Position:</b> The x-axis represents the date of
                        occurrence, and the y-axis shows the number of
                        fatalities.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Color:</b> Indicates the level of aircraft damage,
                        with red for "Destroyed," orange for "Substantial,"
                        yellow for "Minor," and gray for "Unknown."
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                      Faceting by damage level provides insights into the nature
                      and severity of incidents:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <b>Destroyed:</b> The most common category, with
                        incidents clustering around 0–20 fatalities, though
                        high-fatality events appear as notable outliers. This
                        reflects the catastrophic nature of incidents resulting
                        in total aircraft destruction.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Substantial:</b> Incidents show a wide spread of
                        fatality counts, though generally lower than in the
                        "Destroyed" category, indicating serious but often
                        survivable events.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Minor:</b> Rarely observed, reflecting less severe
                        outcomes with minimal fatalities.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <b>Unknown:</b> Sparse data in this category, but
                        occasional high-fatality events suggest gaps in
                        reporting or ambiguous classifications.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                      Filtering options allow users to focus on specific
                      fatality ranges, addressing the high volume of
                      low-fatality incidents that can obscure trends. The zoom
                      feature provides additional flexibility, enabling closer
                      examination of specific time periods or clusters of
                      incidents. This visualization supports tasks such as
                      identifying temporal trends, examining the distribution of
                      fatal injuries across damage levels, and exploring changes
                      in incident severity over time. While it highlights
                      individual incidents, aggregated views of fatalities by
                      month or year may offer complementary insights into
                      overall safety trends and inform targeted interventions.
