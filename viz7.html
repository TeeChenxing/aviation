                      This interactive scatter plot visualizes total fatal
                      aircraft fatalities per month starting in 1980,
                      categorized by the number of engines on the aircraft.
                      Unlike the previous scatter plot, which focuses on
                      individual incidents, this visualization aggregates
                      fatalities by month, providing a clearer perspective on
                      broader trends over time. The data is color-coded by
                      engine type:

                      view of aviation safety across decades and highlights
                      patterns not as easily discernible in incident-level data.

                      One of the most notable trends is the gradual decline in
                      single-engine aircraft fatalities over time. This decrease
                      may reflect advancements in aviation safety technology,
                      better pilot training programs, or the impact of stricter
                      regulations, as single-engine planes are among the most
                      widely used aircraft. In contrast, fatalities involving
                      twin-engine aircraft show more stability over time, though
                      occasional peaks suggest isolated incidents with high
                      fatality counts. Three-engine and four-engine aircraft
                      show sparse but notable data points, with incidents
                      occurring less frequently but often involving high numbers
                      of fatalities. These peaks of high fatalities could be
                      tied to rare large-scale commercial or military accidents,
                      where these aircraft types are more likely to be used.

                      The marks in this visualization are the scatter points
                      representing monthly fatalities, while the channels
                      include color to differentiate between engine types and
                      position on the axes to reflect time and total fatalities.
                      The task of this visualization is to uncover long-term
                      trends in aviation safety across different engine types
                      and to enable a more comprehensive understanding of how
                      safety measures and operational practices have evolved.

                      This visualization is especially valuable for identifying
                      the overall effectiveness of safety initiatives and for
                      pinpointing where further resources should be allocated.
                      The gradual decline in single-engine fatalities is a
                      promising trend, suggesting successful safety
                      interventions, while the more stable patterns in
                      twin-engine aircraft fatalities highlight areas where
                      additional focus could lead to improved outcomes. For
                      aviation authorities, this broader view provides
                      actionable insights to inform future strategies in
                      reducing fatality rates across all engine types.
